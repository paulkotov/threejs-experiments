# ThreeJS Experiments

A collection of experiments and learning projects using Three.js, a cross-browser JavaScript library for creating and displaying animated 3D computer graphics in web browsers.

## 📋 Overview

This project contains various Three.js experiments to explore 3D graphics, animations, and interactive web experiences. It's designed as a learning playground for mastering Three.js concepts and techniques.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Optional: A local web server for development

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/paulkotov/threejs-experiments.git
   cd threejs-experiments
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred code editor

3. Launch a local development server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed globally)
   npx http-server
   
   # Using VS Code Live Server extension
   # Right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server"
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
